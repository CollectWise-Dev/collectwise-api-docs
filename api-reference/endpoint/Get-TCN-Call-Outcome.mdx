title: 'Get TCN Call Outcome'
openapi: 'GET /tcn/call-outcome/{tcn-cid}'
---

## Overview

The TCN Call Outcome API provides a simple endpoint for TCN (Third-Party Call Network) integration to retrieve call outcomes from CollectWise AI agents. This endpoint is designed to support TCN's SIP integration where calls are routed to our AI agents with `X-TCN-cid` headers.

## Authentication

This endpoint requires a valid `collectwise_key` header for API authentication, following the same pattern as other CollectWise API endpoints.

## TCN Action Values

The `action` field in the response can contain one of the following values:

- `"end"` - Call completed normally, no transfer needed
- `"judge_transfer"` - Transfer to judge/supervisor for legal matters
- `"garnishment_transfer"` - Transfer to garnishment specialist
- `"general_transfer"` - General transfer to human agent

## Usage Pattern

This endpoint should be pinged every 1-2 seconds after a call ends, with a timeout of 2-3 minutes. The endpoint will return:

- **200**: Call outcome is available
- **404**: Call is still in progress or outcome not yet available (continue polling)

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.collectwiseapi.com/tcn/call-outcome/12345" \
  -H "collectwise_key: your-api-key-here"
```
