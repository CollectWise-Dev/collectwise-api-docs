## Statuses

CollectWise categorizes debtors using various statuses to indicate the progress and condition of each account:

- **Potential**: A debtor who may become actively managed but has not yet entered the payment cycle.
- **Subscription**: Regular subscription-based payments are being billed.
- **Partial**: A partial payment has been made, but the debt is not fully settled.
- **Paid**: The debtor has fully paid off their outstanding debt.
- **Deleted**: The debtor account has been removed from active management.
- **Paid Creditor Directly**: The debtor has settled the debt directly with the creditor, bypassing CollectWise.
- **Deceased**: The debtor is reported as deceased, halting further collection efforts.
- **Filed Bankruptcy**: The debtor has declared bankruptcy, impacting collection actions.
