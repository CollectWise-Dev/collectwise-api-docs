## Communications Webhook

The Communications webhook provides updates whenever an interaction occurs between CollectWise and a debtor. This includes inbound and outbound SMS or email messages, as well as notifications when a phone call has taken place. Note that phone call events do not specify whether the call was inbound or outbound. The webhook also includes the total number of SMS, emails, or phone communications sent to date.

## Webhook Notification

The webhook sends a payload containing the details of the communication, including the debtor ID, type of communication, and timestamp.

*Note: Phone call events do not include a direction attribute.*
